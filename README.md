Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, Electronics Engineer
---------------------------------------------------------------

Intrigued by machine learning during my Electrical and Electronics Engineering studies with a warning system for autonomous vehicles, I pursued a Computer Engineering Master's to specialize in data science. I've completed diverse projects, including using 3D point clouds to detect vegetation encroachment on powerlines and predicting financial well-being from surveys. Now, I'm eager to delve further into the realm of NLP, excited by the limitless possibilities it offers.
